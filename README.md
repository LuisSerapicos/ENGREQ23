# HappiBee
This repository contains the codebase for an android app built in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose with a Java backend API, as part of a master's degree program in software engineering. The app aims to assist and streamline the tasks involved in beekeeping, offering features tailored to the needs of beekeepers.

## Key Features

- Android App: HappiBee is an Android application developed using Kotlin, the modern and expressive programming language for Android development. Jetpack Compose was utilized for building the user interface, providing a declarative and reactive approach to UI development.

- Backend API: The backend API is implemented in Java, offering a robust and scalable infrastructure to support the app's functionality. It provides the necessary endpoints and services for data management and authentication.

- Firebase Database: Firebase Database is integrated into the app to ensure data consistency between the backend API and the Android app. Real-time synchronization capabilities provided by Firebase Database enable seamless updates and access to beekeeping data across devices.

- Task Management: Schedule and manage beekeeping tasks such as hive inspections, feeding, and harvesting.

- Data Visualization: Utilizing Jetpack Compose's powerful UI capabilities, the app provides intuitive and interactive data visualization tools. Beekeepers can view hive composition and monitoring data.

- Notification System: The app includes a notification system to alert beekeepers of important events, such as upcoming tasks, hive health issues, or environmental conditions affecting bee colonies.
